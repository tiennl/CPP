NO SNOWFLAKE IN AN AVALANCHE EVER FEELS RESPONSIBLE
I DID'NT REALLY SAY EVERYTHING I SAID
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THE TORCH OF TRUTH WITHOUT SINGEING SOMEONES BEARD
ALL THAT PAIN FOR ONE LOUSY STANLEY CUP AND HOCKEY IMMORTALITY
NO ONE REMEMBERS WHO CAME SECOND
I BEAT HIM TWENTY TIMES BUT HE BEAT ME IN THE FINAL AND NOW HE IS THE CHAMP
WE DON'T REMEMBER THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY STRIKEOUTS ONLY THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN HOME RUNS
FAILURE ISN'T AN OPTION
YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY GOOD TO GET THAT LUCKY
PLAY UP PLAY UP AND PLAY THE GAME
ONE'S AIM SHOULD EXCEED ONE'S GRASP OR WHAT IS HEAVEN FOR
FAILURE IS THE CONDIMENT THAT GIVES SUCCESS ITS FLAVOR
CY YOUNG LOST ALMOST AS MANY GAMES AS HE WON
