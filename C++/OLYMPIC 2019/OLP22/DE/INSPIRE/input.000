THIS IS A TEST
THE PAIN OF DISCIPLINE IS NOTHING LIKE THE PAIN OF DISAPPOINTMENT
WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING IT'S THE ONLY THING
WINNERS DON'T WAIT FOR CHANCES THEY TAKE THEM
PAIN IS ONLY TEMPORARY BUT VICTORY IS FOREVER
IF PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND NO ONE IS PERFECT SO WHY PRACTICE
WINNING MEANS YOU'RE WILLING TO GO LONGER WORK HARDER AND GIVE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE
DON'T PRACTICE UNTIL YOU GET IT RIGHT PRACTICE UNTIL YOU CAN'T GET IT WRONG
WHEN YOU PUT ON THAT JERSEY THE NAME ON THE FRONT IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN THE NAME ON THE BACK
LOVE IS PLAYING EVERY GAME AS IF IT'S YOUR LAST
PLAYING HURT IS A MATTER OF PRIDE
GO OUT AND PLAY HARD BASEBALL
BE A GOOD FINISHER
